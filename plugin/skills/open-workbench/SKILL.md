The user wants to open Codex Memory Lab: $ARGUMENTS

Choose the target tab from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- `dashboard`, `home`, `overview`, empty -> `dashboard`
- `memory`, `memories` -> `memories`
- `session`, `sessions`, `timeline` -> `sessions`
- `skill`, `skills`, `plugin` -> `lessons`
- `todo`, `action`, `actions` -> `actions`
- `activity` -> `activity`

Open or share this URL:

```text
http://localhost:3113/#<tab>
```

If browser control is available, open the URL directly. If not, tell the user the exact URL and say to start the service first if it is unreachable:

```bash
agentmemory viewer
```

Do not expose graph/audit/replay/profile as primary destinations; those are implementation/debug surfaces in this product direction.
