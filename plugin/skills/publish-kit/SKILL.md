The user wants to prepare publishing materials: $ARGUMENTS

Check these surfaces:
- GitHub README: product positioning, real product screenshots, concise Chinese explanation when requested.
- Feishu doc: synced with README direction, not stale, not overfull.
- Screenshots: only real product screenshots; avoid loading states, private memory pages, or old upstream images.
- Repository identity: not presented as a random fork if the product direction has diverged.
- Plugin metadata: name, description, homepage, repository, and market entry point match Codex Memory Lab.

Recommended screenshot rule for this project:
- Use only 首页/总览 and Skill 管理台 in public project intro unless the user requests more.
- Avoid memory page screenshots when they contain personal profile content.
- Avoid activity page screenshots while it can stay in loading state.

When editing files, update the source artifact and the published artifact together:
- README changes should be mirrored to Feishu when the user asked for both.
- Feishu docs should use the latest real screenshots.
- Commit and push only after checking the branch/remote target.

End with a short status table: GitHub, Feishu, screenshots, branch, remaining risks.
